# HridayMitra - Your Trusted Companion for Heart Health

**HridayMitra** is a life-saving, open-source mobile app developed to assist individuals during heart-related emergencies with clear, step-by-step instructions validated by medical professionals. Whether you're having a heart attack or helping someone in distress, HridayMitra provides crucial support in real-time.

## Key Features

### 1. **AI-Powered Heart Risk Predictor**
The app features an integrated machine learning model that can assess and predict your risk of heart-related issues. By regularly monitoring your health data, HridayMitra provides early warnings for potential risks, helping users take preventative action.

### 2. **Real-Time Emergency Guidance**
HridayMitra provides real-time, medically validated instructions to guide users during heart emergencies. These instructions are designed for both the individual experiencing the emergency and anyone helping them, ensuring life-saving steps are followed promptly and accurately.

### 3. **User Privacy and Data Security**
Your privacy is our priority. All user data is stored locally on the device, ensuring that no sensitive information is shared without your consent. The app is fully ad-free, providing a seamless and distraction-free experience.

### 4. **Multi-Language Support**
To reach a broader audience, HridayMitra offers support in both **English** and **Hindi**, ensuring users can access the app in their preferred language.

HridayMitra prompts users to keep important information updated, including the details of trusted friends, relatives, and nearby medical centers. This ensures that you have quick access to help when it matters the most.

### 6. **Anonymous Data Sharing for ML Model Improvement**
While all sensitive data remains secure, users have the option to contribute anonymized data (excluding identity, location, and contact information) to improve the AI model. This data will be processed and made available through open-source platforms for research and analysis, enhancing global understanding of heart risks.

## Why Open Source?
